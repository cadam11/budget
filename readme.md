# Budget

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laravel/framework.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/laravel/framework)

Budget is a web application based on the [Laravel framework](http://laravel.com/) for personal financial management. The concept is based on [Mint](http://mint.com) but is self-hosted, rather than delivered as a service. This allows you to remain in control of your own data.

My intention with this project is that it's for personal use, so please don't expect support if you choose to use it.
